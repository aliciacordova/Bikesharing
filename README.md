## Overview

We have been asked to do some analysis and convincing investors of a bike share program in Des Moines is a solid business proposition. For that we analyze the data from New York Citi Bike, in order to obtain the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the weekand the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary

In the analysis of Citi Bike in New York City, we can conclude that most of the use is done in Manhattan during peak hours on weekdays and the most frequent users are men. Citi bike bikes are currently used as a transportation option for workers.

Additional analysis suggestions would be:

- Include rainy days in the data to be able to have a correlation of the weather with the use of bicycles.

- Analyze the most common routes to promote people who go sightseeing and use Citi Bike as a transportation option on weekends. Promotions, discounts, etc. can be placed on these routes to increase the number of users and the use of bicycles.
